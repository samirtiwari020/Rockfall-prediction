🪨 AI-based Rockfall Prediction and Alert System

📌 Overview

Rockfalls in open-pit mines pose a serious risk to workers, equipment, and overall operations. Our project provides an AI-powered prediction and real-time alert system that enhances mining safety by predicting rockfall events before they happen.

This system combines sensor data, environmental parameters, and geotechnical information with advanced machine learning models to deliver early warnings and recommended actions.
